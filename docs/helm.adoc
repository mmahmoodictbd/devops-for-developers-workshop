# Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.


### How to install:

```
brew install kubernetes-helm
```


### Helm initialize

```
helm init
```


### Install charts

Install any chart you want, nice examples https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable[here].

```
helm install --name my-jenkins stable/jenkins --set master.serviceType=NodePort --set master.adminPassword=admin
```

```
NOTE: Most of the charts use service type LoadBalancer by as default. For minikube, set this to NodePort.
```
